### A
The "morning tidy" you're referring to sounds like a morning routine or ritual that helps set the tone for the day, allowing you to stay focused and productive. As a developer working in an agile and scrum environment, the morning routine could be adapted to suit your specific needs. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Morning Reflection (5-10 mins)**

Start your day by taking a moment to yourself. Sit quietly, practice mindfulness, or do a short meditation session. This can help clear your mind and prepare you for the day ahead.

**2. Review Your Calendar and Prioritize (15-20 mins)**

Look at your calendar and the day's schedule. Take note of any important meetings, deadlines, or events for the day. This will give you an overview of how your day is structured.

**3. Agile Stand-up Meeting (15 mins)**

As part of a scrum team, your day should ideally start with a stand-up meeting. This is where you communicate what you did the previous day, what you plan to do today, and any blockers that might prevent you from completing your tasks. This meeting can help you clearly understand your immediate responsibilities for the day.

**4. Set Your Daily Goals (10-15 mins)**

Based on the stand-up meeting and your own tasks, define your goals for the day. Break down your tasks into manageable parts and set clear, achievable goals. Remember to prioritize them based on importance and urgency, using a method like the Eisenhower Matrix.

**5. Deep Work Sessions (90 mins each)**

Post planning, dedicate time for uninterrupted work. This concept, also known as "deep work", involves focusing on a single task for a period of time without distractions. This could be coding, debugging, writing documentation, etc. You might want to start with a session right after your planning if your schedule allows.

**6. Regular Breaks (5-15 mins)**

Take regular short breaks between deep work sessions to rest and recharge. You can use techniques like the Pomodoro technique, which involves working for a set period of time (e.g., 25 minutes) and then taking a short break (e.g., 5 minutes).

**7. Check-in and Adjust (10 mins)**

At various points throughout the day, take a moment to check in with yourself. Are you on track with your goals for the day? If not, what adjustments can you make? This can be a good time to reassess your priorities if necessary.

**8. End of Day Review (10-15 mins)**

At the end of the day, review your progress. What tasks did you complete? What needs to be moved to tomorrow's list? Reflecting on your day can help you understand how your time was spent, and provides insight into how you can improve your productivity in the future.

Remember, it's important to customize this routine to suit your individual needs and work style. It might take some trial and error to find the routine that works best for you.
